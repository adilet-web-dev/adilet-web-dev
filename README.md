## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am junior Python backend developer.

my skills:

- Python
- Django
- Postgresql
- Git
- Linux/bash
- unittest
- 
can use
- Docker
- CI/CD

projects:
- [Music Releases](https://github.com/adilet-web-dev/music-releases) - The closed platform for labels where they can share, trade, promote releases with each other.
Labels can join the platform by using invitation links. Labels can write messages inside the platform and request releases purchase. Also, labels can share submission links with artists and bands so they can send demo to labels.

About me:
I always try to write clean code observing PEP 8, SOLID, DRY principles and write unit tests to keep high code quality.
